## About Me
I am currently a student at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am passionate about programming in Java, C/C++, and Javascript and I spend my free time building applications. 

I enjoy numerous areas of Computer Science and I realize my main interest is with space and cryptology. I love astronomy and the study of the universe. Space is vast in comparison to our world and any contribution to its exploration in any form would be amazing. Cryptology is also fascinating to me in the fact that it has been around for centuries, and people still use it today to exchange messages. I find it fun to research, analyze, and prototype different encryption techniques; these techniques allow you to enter into the minds of people from hundreds years ago and discover hidden messages they were trying to share. I look forward to working in one of these areas someday.

## Other Interests
Beyond my love for Computer Science, I have been working with children for over eight years. I volunteer at a church to watch, engage, and nurture younger children. I am dedicated to taking care of children and helping them---whether being their friend or their playmate while encouraging them to reach their full potential.  

Math is so much fun and I use my free time to tutor other students who struggle in math. Teaching students how to approach problems and finding new ways to convey the subject matter is quite rewarding.

Outside computer science and school, playing sports was a big part of my childhood growing up and I have been playing soccer, volleyball, and other team sports for many years.
